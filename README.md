# EMNLP 2017: Neural Variational Document Models w/ Piecewise Latent Variables (Serban, Ororbia, Pineau, and Courville)
Code to support the paper "Piecewise Latent Variables for Neural Variational Text Processing" for EMNLP 2017. 
Specifically, this repo houses the Scala code for the document models (built on top of the library YANNL - Yet Another Neural Network Library, Ororbia 2017).

# TODO
[NOTE: We are still in the process of cleaning this code up, as such, users should not use this just yet!]

[NOTE: the two required JAR dependencies, YANNL and YAVL, will be uploaded soon.]

[NOTE: Usage directions to be uploaded soon.]
